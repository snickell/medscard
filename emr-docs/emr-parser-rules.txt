Also, if the words apply, cream, ointment, lotion, shampoo or gel are anywhere in the line, it should be just a single pill at whatever frequency is written. 

** Daily or qam or each morning or every morning or qday or q24 or qdaily or q24h = morning
** Bid or twice daily or twice a day or two times daily or two times a day or q12 or q12h = morning and night (unless the words ac or with meals or before meals, then = morning and evening)
** Qhs or qpm or each night or every night or each evening or every evening or at bedtime = night (unless the words ac or with meal or before meal or with dinner or before dinner, then = evening)
** Tid or q8 or q8h or three times daily or three times a day = morning noon and night (unless the words ac or with meals or before meals, then = morning noon and evening)
** Qid or q6 or q6h or four times a day or four times daily = all four times

Confusing enough for you?

And finally, prn or as needed should be identified somehow, eg grouped into a category at the end with the words AS NEEDED on the line above.
